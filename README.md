# ECE387-midterm
# laptop software - accessport
# Using a usb to TTL module to transfer speech comment
# in accessport, code (AA 36) start recording command, 5 command in group with code(AA 11 to AA 15)
# code (AA 21) import speech command to speech module

# issue: only 5 command can stay in one group by using accessport, so I didn't do LED turn off action in my project. Sometimes green LED does no reaction with call and it only happens on green light. I tried to redo recording but still work.
